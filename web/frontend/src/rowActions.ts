// Shared row-action discipline for every island with per-row mutation
// buttons (Wanted Search, Queue Retry, Blocklist Allow/Remove, ...).
//
// Rapid clicks across different rows must ALL land. That imposes three
// rules the earlier copy-pasted handlers each broke in the same ways:
//  - pending state is per row (a single shared pendingId re-enabled row A's
//    button and hid its progress the moment row B was clicked);
//  - the follow-up table reload is coalesced to once per click-burst
//    (reloading after every click reshuffles rows under the cursor and
//    eats the next click);
//  - an action failure survives the reload (the reload's own error reset
//    used to wipe the only message saying which click failed).
//
// That last rule is why failures have to be retired deliberately rather
// than on the next render: nothing else clears them. Every operation gets a
// monotonic sequence number at click time, and the announced failure
// remembers which operation raised it, so ordering decides who wins:
//  - a NEWER operation succeeding retires an older operation's failure --
//    the banner is about a click the operator has since superseded;
//  - an OLDER operation completing (success or failure) never touches a
//    newer failure -- otherwise a slow first request landing after a fast
//    second one would erase the message describing the click that just
//    failed;
//  - a newer failure always replaces an older one.
//
// Those rules have to hold on arrival order too, which is why success is
// remembered even when there is no failure to retire. The first version only
// retired an EXISTING failure, so a newer success that landed before an older
// failure recorded nothing, and the late older failure was then announced as
// if nothing had superseded it. Identical clicks and identical outcomes gave
// opposite banners depending purely on which request the server answered
// first:
//   fail(1) then succeed(2) -> banner cleared
//   succeed(2) then fail(1) -> banner announced
// So the newest successfully settled sequence is tracked, and a failure older
// than it is never announced.
// Without this, the banner only cleared when the surrounding shell handed
// the island a fresh `payload` prop -- which the hook's own reload does not
// produce -- so a failed mutation stayed announced, indefinitely and
// looking current, through any number of later successful ones.
