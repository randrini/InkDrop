"""One place where InkDrop authenticates to qBittorrent.

Every caller that talks to the qBittorrent Web API goes through `authenticate`.
Before this module there were eight hand-rolled copies of the login POST, so a
fix in one of them (the settings "Test" button, say) left the other seven --
the ones that actually download things -- still broken.

Two auth methods, and they are mutually exclusive per request:

* API key (qBittorrent >= 5.2.0, Web API >= 2.14.1). Sent as
  `Authorization: Bearer qbt_...`. qBittorrent's own docs are explicit that a
  key "cannot interact with the WebAPI's auth endpoints, including login and
  logout", so a key must skip `/api/v2/auth/login` entirely. Logging in first
  and then adding the header is not a harmless belt-and-braces -- an API-key
  user has no Web UI password to log in with, so the login call fails and takes
  the whole request with it.
* Username and password, which posts to `/api/v2/auth/login` and keeps the
  session cookie. Still supported in 5.2.0; keys did not replace it.

The response classification below is taken from qBittorrent's source rather
than guessed, because the status codes are counter-intuitive:

* Wrong password answers **HTTP 200** with the body `Fails.` -- not a 401.
* `401` on the login endpoint therefore is not a credentials problem at all.
  It is Host header validation refusing the address before it ever looks at
  the password, which is what a Docker bridge IP or a reverse proxy usually
  trips.
* `403` is the failed-attempt ban, checked *before* the password. A banned IP
  keeps failing after the user fixes their password, which is exactly the
  situation where a generic "authentication failed" sends someone re-typing a
  password that was right all along.
