"""Read-only, diff-based event detection for the notifications system.

Turns raw pipeline/state-DB rows into notification events without touching
the pipeline: every query here is a plain read-only SELECT against tables
inkdrop_state.py owns, diffed against last-seen state kept in
inkdrop_notification_store's watch-state table. Nothing here writes to
queue_items / download_tasks / series / issues, calls into the matching or
candidate-acceptance pipeline, or imports inkdrop_state.py's write paths.

"grabbed" and "download_failed" are scoped deliberately narrow: download_tasks
is a per-attempt table with heavy internal retry churn (most "failed" rows are
routine, automatically-retried candidate attempts, not something a user should
be paged about). So the signal used here is a task actually reaching a
downloading state (grabbed), and -- only for tasks this module already
announced as grabbed -- that same task later reaching a terminal failed state
(retry_eligible=0). That pairing is what keeps this from turning into noise.
