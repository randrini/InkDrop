"""Resumable wrapper around `inkdrop_completed_import.py --slskd-staging`.

Problem: a plain `--all-series --slskd-staging` run has to walk and evaluate
every file in the SLSKD staging root before it can decide what's new, which
on the real backlog takes far longer than this host's containers currently
stay up between redeploys. A restart mid-scan throws all of that work away
and the next run starts over from zero.

Fix: process one file at a time via the *existing, unmodified*
`inkdrop_completed_import.py --source-file <path> --all-series --slskd-staging`
invocation (that flag already exists and already bypasses the broad
directory walk for a single explicit file), and persist each file's outcome
to a checkpoint table keyed on (path, size, mtime) immediately after it's
decided -- not batched at the end. A file already checkpointed with an
unchanged size/mtime is skipped without touching the expensive matching /
hashing / archive-validation path again. This does not change any matching,
duplicate-detection, or import logic at all -- it only decides which files
are worth asking `inkdrop_completed_import.py` about on a given run.
