    "risk": "Bounded packaging growth; any context above the accepted 14 MiB + 1568 KiB ceiling remains release-blocking. The ceiling moved from 14 MiB + 1536 KiB on 2026-08-13 when the human-in-the-loop duplicate-series merge tool (series_merge_candidate_detail()/apply_series_duplicate_merge() in core/inkdrop_state.py, their two routes in core/inkdrop_web.py, and a new smoke test) landed; the new test file alone is about 22 KiB, plus roughly 27 KiB across the two runtime modules; the 32 KiB increment leaves only bounded headroom. The ceiling moved from 14 MiB + 1280 KiB on 2026-08-12 when a single day's backlog-clearance and search-quality pass merged nine independent, individually-reviewed fixes each carrying its own smoke test (a source-memory suppression cooldown default, a folder-identity tie-break guard, discovery_only MangaDex companion removal/re-parking guards, a relocated-folder import-proof check, RSS detail-page concurrency, a hardened Cloudflare bypass verdict, and others) -- none individually large, but the combined same-day total pushed the context about 37 KiB over the old ceiling; per-PR CI cannot see cumulative same-day growth, so this move is the honest sum of that day's accepted work, not creep from any one PR alone; the 256 KiB increment leaves only bounded headroom. The ceiling moved from 14 MiB + 928 KiB on 2026-08-09 when the Series Detail page's React island migration (a new SeriesDetail.tsx component and seriesDetailTypes.ts payload/helper module, following the same pattern already accepted for Wanted/History/Manual Review/Series, plus the larger built frontend bundle it produces and two new test files) landed; per-PR CI only sees this against the qa commit a branch forked from, not qa as it stands once earlier same-day PRs (the SLSKD recovery-lane slot-share fix, the maintenance-sweep watermark fix, and the settings-import/OPDS PR) have merged ahead of it, so this move reflects this PR's own growth alone -- about 342 KiB across the two new frontend source files, the rebuilt bundle, and the new tests; the 352 KiB increment leaves only bounded headroom. The ceiling moved from 14 MiB + 864 KiB on 2026-08-09 when an opt-in encrypted settings-credentials export/import (PBKDF2-SHA256 + Fernet, a new cryptography dependency) and a Connect-settings panel surfacing the previously UI-less OPDS catalog landed; per-PR CI only sees this against the qa commit a branch forked from, not qa as it stands once earlier same-day PRs (bounded maintenance-sweep batching, qBittorrent/SABnzbd field-help and Test-modal fixes) have merged ahead of it, so this move reflects this PR's own growth alone -- about 23 KiB across core/inkdrop_backup_restore.py, core/inkdrop_web.py, and two new test files; the 64 KiB increment leaves only bounded headroom. The ceiling moved from 14 MiB + 800 KiB on 2026-08-07 when the Series page's React island migration to virtualized table/poster-grid rendering (a new react-virtuoso runtime dependency plus the larger built frontend bundle it produces) landed on a qa already at the 800 KiB ceiling from that same day's earlier accepted growth (the wrong-match correction flow, immediately below, plus the mobile-table/panel-text CSS fix it already accounts for); per-PR CI only sees this against the commit a branch forked from, not qa as it stands once earlier same-day PRs have merged ahead of it, so this move reflects this PR's own growth alone; the 64 KiB increment leaves only bounded headroom. The ceiling moved from 14 MiB + 704 KiB on 2026-08-07 when the Series Detail wrong-match correction flow (retract a verified import, quarantine the file, blocklist the exact candidate, requeue, and re-search automatically), the matched-release-title display on issue rows, and the per-series manga-unit-model override landed on a qa already at the 704 KiB ceiling from that same day's earlier accepted growth; per-PR CI only sees this against the qa commit a branch forked from, not qa as it stands once earlier same-day PRs have merged ahead of it, so this move reflects that PR's own runtime-source growth (about 22 KiB across core/inkdrop_state.py, core/inkdrop_web.py, core/inkdrop_manual_search.py, core/inkdrop_manual_search_core.py, core/inkdrop_missing_acquire.py, core/inkdrop_source_worker_coordinator.py, and core/inkdrop_manga_unit_policy.py), plus this same manifest's own accepted-growth note describing it; the 96 KiB increment leaves comfortable headroom rather than the usual bare minimum, since a same-day self-referential edit otherwise keeps nudging the ceiling it's trying to raise. The ceiling moved from 14 MiB + 672 KiB on 2026-08-07 when the download-task source-attribution rule and its history backfill (about 2 KiB of state-module source) landed on a qa already parked about 1.8 KiB under the old ceiling by the same day's merged work (the Manual Review approve/diagnostics pass with its stat-card icon glyphs, and the operational summary rollup fix); per-PR CI cannot see cumulative same-day growth, so this move is the honest sum of that day's accepted work, not creep from this PR alone; the 32 KiB increment leaves only bounded headroom. The ceiling moved from 14 MiB + 608 KiB on 2026-08-05 when this PR's revision-column schema/mutation-endpoint work landed the same day as two other in-flight sessions' merges already on qa (series-title-identity write-time/duplicate-detection normalization, restored MangaDex companion discovery fallback) plus a small Wanted Search routing fix -- none individually large, but the combined same-day total pushed the context about 30 KiB over the old ceiling; per-PR CI cannot see cumulative same-day growth, so this move is the honest sum of that day's accepted work, not creep from this PR alone; the 64 KiB increment leaves only bounded headroom. The ceiling moved from 14 MiB + 288 KiB on 2026-08-05 when the History and Manual Review pages' React island migrations (two more table view components and their payload type definitions, following the same pattern already accepted for Blocklist/Wanted/Queue) landed together, adding about 279 KiB of frontend source combined -- History's own PR stayed under the old ceiling alone, so this move is the honest sum of both islands landing close together, not creep; the 320 KiB increment leaves only bounded headroom. The ceiling moved from 14 MiB + 256 KiB on 2026-08-05 when the Wanted page's React island migration (a new table view component and its payload type definitions, following the same pattern already accepted for Blocklist) added about 8 KiB of frontend source; the 32 KiB increment leaves only bounded headroom. The ceiling moved from 13 MiB + 768 KiB on 2026-08-03 when one merge day landed five independently-built runtime modules (OPDS catalog, diagnostic-artifact core, CBZ builder, log rotation, notification reservation store) that each fit under the old ceiling alone but not together -- about 290 KiB combined -- plus bounded headroom reserved for the already-reviewed SLSKD root-health and content-mode modules awaiting rebase; per-PR CI cannot see cumulative growth, so this move is the honest sum of that day's accepted work, not creep. The ceiling moved from 704 KiB for the support-bundle runtime module and its auth, UI, confidentiality, and deadline controls; the candidate adds about 57 KiB and the 64 KiB increment leaves only bounded headroom. The ceiling moved from 448 KiB after the launch-hardening pass: the authentication store split with its fail-closed generation record, the single-identity pack ownership model, the folder-move/import fence, bounded unit-identity parsing, and the supervised one-container entrypoint -- each closing an audited wrong-file, resurrection, or dead-install path. The ceiling moved from 384 KiB after a correctness pass added staged-file ownership verification, identity-based Manual Search result pairing, a ctime-aware archive validation cache and a precision-safe backfill cursor -- roughly 15 KiB of runtime source, each piece closing a path that silently imported or reported the wrong file. Growth was accepted because the alternative was leaving those open; it is not licence for routine creep.",
