"""Regression for the notifications wiring added to the two 'Wanted cleared'
settlement paths and the shared 'append_manual_review' choke point.

Proves the wiring actually calls into inkdrop_notifications with the right
event data -- not just that the settlement/review logic still runs. Uses
targeted mocking at the settlement boundary (verified_import_for_queue /
mark_queue_verified_for_import) rather than a full on-disk import fixture,
since the notification call itself is what's under test here, not import
verification.
