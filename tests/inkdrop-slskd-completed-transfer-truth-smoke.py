"""SLSKD reports a transfer Completed, Succeeded while InkDrop leaves the
Wanted unit queued/searching, or announces a permanent download failure that
contradicts an active, still-retryable queue.

Three stacked defects, fixed together in report order:

1. An import row with an explicit negative status (rejected/removed/missing/
   superseded) could still be treated as an authoritative owner of the
   Wanted unit if a stale positive column (verified/folder_imported/
   completion_truth) was left behind by an earlier transition -- fencing a
   later, genuinely completed SLSKD recovery. Live data had 93 such
   contradictory rows.
2. One physical SLSKD transfer could be claimed by more than one InkDrop
   download_tasks row for the same exact Wanted unit (a reservation task
   plus a later waiting-record projection); reconciliation treated every
   such group as ambiguous and did nothing. Live data had 35 such groups.
3. inkdrop_notification_events.py announced an attempt-level failure
   (retry_eligible=0 on one task) as an absolute item-level "will not be
   retried automatically" even while the canonical queue remained active,
   retryable, or already had a completed sibling/import.
